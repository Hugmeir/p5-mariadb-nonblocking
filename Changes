        * Look for headers/libraries in MariaDB-specific
          paths before going for the more generic ones.

0.08    2017-10-12
        * Added a plain eventloop implementation, and
          then reimplemented the promises version as a
          thin wrapper of that.
        * Simplified the API; now there are only three
          methods (connect, run_query, ping) which are
          called on connections, rather than class
          methods that got called on pools of connections.

0.07    2017-09-13
        * DESTROY() will now reject all pending promises.
        * AnyEvent::detect() will be called before the first
          query, assuming nothing else called it first.

0.06    2017-09-06
        * Work with AnyEvent, and utilize less watchers if
          we can -- mostly if we are using EV.

        * want_hashrefs was returning read-only undefs

0.04    2017-07-31
